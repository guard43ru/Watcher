# About Watcher

Watcher is a daemon that watches specified files/folders for changes and
fires commands in response to those changes. It is similar to
[incron](http://incron.aiken.cz), however, configuration uses a simpler
to read ini file instead of a plain text file. Unlike incron it can also
recursively monitor directories.

It's written in Python, making it easier to hack.

This fork is a rewritting of the code using python-daemon implementation of [PEP3143](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/) 

## Requirements

You need Python 2.7 and the following modules that can be installed with your package manager or `pip`:

* [pyinotify](http://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify)
* [python-daemon](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/python-daemon/)
* [lockfile](https://launchpad.net/pylockfile)
* [chardet](https://chardet.github.io/)

To install modules on Debian:

    sudo apt-get install python-pyinotify python-daemon python-lockfile python-chardet
    
To install modules on Gentoo:

    emerge -av dev-python/pyinotify dev-python/python-daemon dev-python/lockfile dev-python/chardet

To install `pip` on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install pip

To install the modules:

    sudo pip install python-daemon lockfile pyinotify chardet

For Python 3, install [python-daemon-3K](https://github.com/jbvsmo/python-daemon) instead of python-daemon:

    sudo pip install python-daemon-3K lockfile pyinotify chardet

## Configuration

See the provided `watcher.conf` file for an example job configuration. The
config file should reside in `/etc/watcher.conf` or `~/.watcher.conf`. You
can also specify the path to the config file as a command line parameter
using the `--config` option.

If you edit the ini file you must restart the daemon for it to reload the
configuration.

## Starting the Daemon

Make sure watcher.py is marked as executable:

    chmod +x watcher.py

Start the daemon with:

    ./watcher.py start

Stop it with:

    ./watcher.py stop

Restart it with:

    ./watcher.py restart

If you don't want the daemon to fork to the background, start it with

    ./watcher.py debug

## Autostart Watcher on system startup

There is some init startup scripts in repo (gentoo, debian and systemd unit). Use your init system manual to install them properly.

For debian:

    cp init.watcher.debian /etc/init.d/watcher
    update-rc.d watcher defaults
    /etc/init.d/watcher start
    
For gentoo:

    cp init.watcher.gentoo /etc/init.d/watcher
    rc-update add watcher default
    /etc/init.d/watcher start
    
For systemd:

    cp init.watcher.unit /etc/systemd/system/watcher.service
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable watcher
    systemctl start watcher
